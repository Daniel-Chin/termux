This is for me only. 

This repo is useful because private storage in Android is hard to access and therefore hard to backup. 

## Instructions: 
- Install termux from Github.  
- `pkg install git`  
- Clone this repo into "~".  
- `cd` into "usr/bin"  
- `./chmod +x ch_my_mod`  
- `./ch_my_mod`  
- Copy the entire repo outwards into "~/..".
