This is for me only. 

This repo is useful because private storage in Android is hard to access and therefore hard to backup. 

## Instructions: 
- Install termux from Github.  
- `pkg install git`  
- Clone this repo into "~".  
- `cd` into "termux/usr/bin".  
- `bash ./ch_my_mod`  
- Copy the entire repo outwards into "~/..".  
  - Something like `cp -r ~/termux ~/..`
- run daniel_setup manually line-by-line.
